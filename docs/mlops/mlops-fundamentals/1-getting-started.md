# Getting Started with MLOps

Welcome to the **MLOps Fundamentals** series! In this tutorial, we'll take you from understanding what MLOps is to building production-ready ML systems.

---

## What is MLOps?

**MLOps (Machine Learning Operations)** is a set of practices that combines Machine Learning, DevOps, and Data Engineering to deploy and maintain ML systems in production reliably and efficiently.

MLOps bridges the gap between ML model development and operations, enabling:

- **Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery** for ML models
- **Model versioning** and experiment tracking
- **Automated training** pipelines
- **Model monitoring** and drift detection
- **Scalable inference** infrastructure

:::info Definition
**MLOps** = Machine Learning + DevOps + Data Engineering
:::

Think of MLOps as the answer to the question every Data Scientist eventually asks: *"My model works great in Jupyter — how do I get it to production?"*

## Key Components

### 1. Data Pipeline
Managing data collection, validation, and preprocessing in a reproducible manner.

### 2. Model Training
Automating model training with experiment tracking and hyperparameter optimization.

### 3. Model Registry
Version control for ML models with metadata tracking.

### 4. Model Serving
Deploying models for inference with proper scaling and monitoring.

### 5. Monitoring
Tracking model performance, data drift, and system health.

## What's Next?

Now that you understand what MLOps is and why it matters, let's explore the human side: **building the right team**. In the next section, we'll introduce the key roles in an ML team and how they work together.
